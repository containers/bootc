# NAME

bootc-install - Install the running container to a target

# SYNOPSIS

**bootc install** \[**-h**\|**\--help**\] \<*subcommands*\>

# DESCRIPTION

Install the running container to a target.

\## Understanding installations

OCI containers are effectively layers of tarballs with JSON for
metadata; they cannot be booted directly. The \`bootc install\` flow is
a highly opinionated method to take the contents of the container image
and install it to a target block device (or an existing filesystem) in
such a way that it can be booted.

For example, a Linux partition table and filesystem is used, and the
bootloader and kernel embedded in the container image are also prepared.

A bootc installed container currently uses OSTree as a backend, and this
sets it up such that a subsequent \`bootc upgrade\` can perform in-place
updates.

An installation is not simply a copy of the container filesystem, but
includes other setup and metadata.
