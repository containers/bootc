# NAME

bootc-usr-overlay - Adds a transient writable overlayfs on \`/usr\` that
will be discarded on reboot

# SYNOPSIS

**bootc usr-overlay** \[**-h**\|**\--help**\]

# DESCRIPTION

Adds a transient writable overlayfs on \`/usr\` that will be discarded
on reboot.

\## Use cases

A common pattern is wanting to use tracing/debugging tools, such as
\`strace\` that may not be in the base image. A system package manager
such as \`apt\` or \`dnf\` can apply changes into this transient overlay
that will be discarded on reboot.

\## /etc and /var

However, this command has no effect on \`/etc\` and \`/var\` - changes
written there will persist. It is common for package installations to
modify these directories.

\## Unmounting

Almost always, a system process will hold a reference to the open mount
point. You can however invoke \`umount -l /usr\` to perform a \"lazy
unmount\".
