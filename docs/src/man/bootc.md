# SYNOPSIS

\<*subcommands*\>

# DESCRIPTION

Deploy and transactionally in-place with bootable container images.

The \`bootc\` project currently uses ostree-containers as a backend to
support a model of bootable container images. Once installed, whether
directly via \`bootc install\` (executed as part of a container) or via
another mechanism such as an OS installer tool, further updates can be
pulled and \`bootc upgrade\`.
